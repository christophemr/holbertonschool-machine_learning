# Calculus Project

This project covers various topics in calculus, including summation and product notations, derivatives, integrals, and partial derivatives. The goal is to understand and apply these concepts through multiple-choice questions and Python scripts.

## Requirements

### Multiple Choice Questions

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Type the number of the correct answer in your answer file
- All your files should end with a new line

Example:

```bash
What is 9 squared?

Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)

17. Integrate
File: 17-integrate.py

Write a function def poly_integral(poly, C=0): that calculates the integral of a polynomial:

poly is a list of coefficients representing a polynomial
The index of the list represents the power of x that the coefficient belongs to
Example: if f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 5, poly is equal to [5, 3, 0, 1]
C is an integer representing the integration constant
If a coefficient is a whole number, it should be represented as an integer
If poly or C are not valid, return None
Return a new list of coefficients representing the integral of the polynomial
The returned list should be as small as possible
Example:

bash
Copier le code
alexa@ubuntu:calculus$ cat 17-main.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

poly_integral = __import__('17-integrate').poly_integral

poly = [5, 3, 0, 1]
print(poly_integral(poly))
alexa@ubuntu:calculus$ ./17-main.py
[0, 5, 1.5, 0, 0.25]
