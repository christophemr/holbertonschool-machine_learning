### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General

- What is a vector?
- What is a matrix?
- What is a transpose?
- What is the shape of a matrix?
- What is an axis?
- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?
- What is Numpy?
- What is parallelization and why is it important?
- What is broadcasting?

### Requirements

#### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.11.1)
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").**doc**)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.**doc**)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").my_function.**doc**)' and python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.my_function.**doc**)')
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
