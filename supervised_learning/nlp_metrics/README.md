# nlp_metrics
This directory continues work with natural language processing (NLP) by looking at metrics used to evaluate Machine Translations:

## Mandatory Tasks:
0. [Unigram BLEU score](/supervised_learning/nlp_metrics/0-uni_bleu.py)
*    function def uni_bleu(references, sentence): that calculates the unigram BLEU score for a sentence
1. [N-gram BLEU score](/supervised_learning/nlp_metrics/1-ngram_bleu.py)
*   function def ngram_bleu(references, sentence, n): that calculates the n-gram BLEU score for a sentence
2. [Cumulative N-gram BLEU score](/supervised_learning/nlp_metrics/2-cumulative_bleu.py)
*   function def cumulative_bleu(references, sentence, n): that calculates the cumulative n-gram BLEU score for a sentence
